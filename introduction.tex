\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{What is C++}
  C++ is a complex and large programming language (and library)
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item strongly and statically typed
    \item general-purpose
    \item multi-paradigm
    \item good from low-level programming to high-level abstractions
    \item efficient (\textit{``you don't pay for what you don't use''})
    \item standard
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Learn more}

      \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Standards}

  \begin{itemize}

  \item A new standard is published every three years.

  \item \textit{Working drafts}, almost the same as the final published document
    \begin{description}
    \item [C++03] \url{https://wg21.link/n1905}
    \item [C++11] \url{https://wg21.link/std11}
    \item [C++14] \url{https://wg21.link/std14}
    \item [C++17] \url{https://wg21.link/std17}
    \item [C++20] \url{https://wg21.link/std20}
    \item [C++2b] \url{https://wg21.link/std} (current draft)
    \end{description}

    \LaTeX sources at \url{https://github.com/cplusplus/draft}

  \item \textit{Working papers} at {\footnotesize
    \url{http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/}}

  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Compilers}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The ESC machines provide many compilers: use gcc 9.2, possibly in C++17 mode (see instructions on how to enable
  it)
  \item You can also edit and try your code online with multiple compilers at
